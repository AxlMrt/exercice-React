This is a practice to handle Input and display them on a page.

I first created a state to create an object and second wich contains an array to push the object in.
I've used "Uniquid" to create a key on each paragraph.

I did not use ES6 classes because the abuse of "This" is really confusing. To say more, with **Functionnal components**, the component starts out much lighter and you can add capabilities as you need them with **Hooks**.
